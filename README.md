# TodoList

## Summary
My implementation of [To-Do List module of Learners Guild curriculum]  (https://curriculum.learnersguild.org/Phases/Practice/Modules/To-Do-List/).
A full-stack single-page CRUD web application where users can:
 - create,
 - edit the text,
 - check tasks as completed,
 - undo completed task(check it as not completed),
 - delete tasks.


## What I learned doing this project:
- using Express.js
- building RESTful APIs using Express  
- using Postgres to persist data in database
- writing basic SQL queries  
- using Fetch API to make HTTP requests  
- using `contenteditable` attribute of HTML
